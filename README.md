All Modes are compile and are fully functional with the Mono/Stereo path.
However, when running mode 3 in conjunction with the RDS functions, the program crashes.
In order to test Mode 3, comment out all the RDS function. See code comments for more details. 




## Real-time SDR for mono/stereo FM and RDS

The main objective of the project is to navigate a complex speciÔ¨Åcation and to develop the understanding for the challenges that must be addressed for a real-time implementation of a computing system that operates in a form factor-constrained environment.
